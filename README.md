## 📂 Repository Structure

The project is organized into 6 specialized directories, each representing a key area of system analysis:

| Directory | Topic | Key MATLAB Features |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lab1_direct_calc` | **Direct Calculations** | Session logging (`diary`), complex numbers, basic arithmetic.|
| `lab2_matrices` | **Vector & Matrix Ops** | Special matrix generation (`rand`, `ones`, `eye`), data sorting.|
| `lab3_sys_analysis` | **System Analysis Ops** | Matrix inversion, eigenvalues/eigenvectors, transition matrices.|
| `lab4_matrix_eq` | **Matrix Equations** | Solving Lyapunov and Riccati equations for control theory.|
| `lab5_plots` | **Data Visualization** | 2D/3D Plotting, surfaces, polar coordinates, shading.|
| `lab6_algebra_analysis` | **Algebra & Analysis** | Symbolic transformations, numerical integration, derivatives.|

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run these scripts, you need:

- **MATLAB** (R2020b or newer recommended).
- **Symbolic Math Toolbox** (required for Lab 3 and Lab 6).



### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/name-of-repo.git

```


2. Navigate to the specific lab directory:
```bash
cd lab3_sys_analysis

```


3. Run the `solution.m` script in MATLAB.

## 📈 Key Outcomes
