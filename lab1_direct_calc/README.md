# Lab 1: Direct Calculations in MATLAB

## 🎯 Purpose
To study the MATLAB user interface and master basic calculations, variable management, and session logging.

## 🛠 Execution Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
* Initialized a working log using the `diary` command.
* Configured the output to scientific notation using `format short e`.

### 2. Task Execution
* **Arithmetic Expression:** Calculated $abs(A + B + C) / D$ using standard mathematical functions.
* **Complex Variables:** Defined  $z = 7 + 4i$  based on the length of my name and surname.
* **Analysis:** Utilized `real()`, `imag()`, and `abs()` functions to analyze the complex number.
* **Trigonometry:** Evaluated complex trigonometric sums.

## 📊 Results
All calculations were performed via the Command Window. Detailed logs and values are stored in the `solution.m` file within this directory.

**Key Output Values:**
* Task 1 Result: `3.6788e-01`
* Complex Magnitude: `8.0623e+00`
* Final Expression: `2.7313e+01 - 2.7100e+01i`

## ✅ Conclusion
I successfully learned how to use MATLAB for direct calculations. The work covered variable assignments, complex number manipulation, and session documentation.
